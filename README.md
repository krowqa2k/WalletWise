Wallet Wise is an expense management app that allows users to track their transactions and visualize data using Charts. The app is built using SwiftUI and stores data locally using UserDefaults. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for a clean and maintainable codebase.

Features:

- Add Transactions: Users can add new transactions with details such as name, amount, category, and date.
- View Transactions: Display all transactions in a list, categorized by day.
- Charts: Visualize expenses using line chart.
- Clear All Transactions: Remove all transactions with a single button click.

Technologies Used:

- SwiftUI: For building the user interface.
- MVVM Architecture: For a clean separation of concerns and improved testability.
- Xcode 15.4: The development environment used for building the app.
- SwiftUICharts: package used for more responsible and good looking chart.
- UserDefaults: for storing transactions and user data

Coming later: 
- UserDefaults transactions storage switched to CoreData
